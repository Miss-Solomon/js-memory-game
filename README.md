<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The aim of this project is to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills by building a fun project. This project showed me how the three most important technologies work together to develop and design websites.

The goal of the game is to successfully match eight colors to earn points. The game starts by presenting the player with a grid of sixteen squares. When the player clicks on each square, the background color is revealed. After two wrong guesses, the background color is hidden. The player must remember where each color is hidden and find the matching color pairs to complete the game. Once the game is completed, the player is presented with a button that says "Play Again." This will reset the game for another round. The colors are randomized to make it challenging to match pairs.
